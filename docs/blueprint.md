- Background color: Clean white (#FAFAFA) for a bright and uncluttered feel.
- Accent color: A slightly darker analogous shade of green (#7ED957) for interactive elements to help with UX/UI and make users click and stay more.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif combining a modern look with warmth, is used to provide a visually appealing design with great legibility on mobile and web interfaces.
- Use modern and outlined icons related to vehicles, dates, and locations.
- Use a clean, card-based layout for vehicle listings. Display GPS and real-time data and statistics as simple blocks in a standard report or status fashion.
- Subtle transitions and animations on button interaction
